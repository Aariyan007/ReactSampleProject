# K72 Website Clone (Frontend)

A high-fidelity frontend clone of **k72.ca**, rebuilt from scratch using React and GSAP.

This project focuses on recreating the original visual experience while extending it with additional UI interactions, smoother animations, and custom scroll behavior. It represents my final MERN frontend project, with strong emphasis on motion, performance, and clean component architecture.

## What This Project Is

- A **pixel-close clone** of k72.ca’s UI
- Built to study and master **modern animation-driven web design**
- Extended with **custom features and enhanced scroll interactions**
- Frontend-only project (ready to plug into a MERN backend if needed)

## Key Highlights

- Advanced **GSAP animations**
- Heavy use of **ScrollTrigger** for section-based motion
- Smooth scroll-linked transitions
- Modular React component structure
- Performance-conscious animation handling
- Fully responsive layout

## Added / Improved Features

- Enhanced scroll timing and easing
- Additional animated sections not present in the original site
- Improved interaction feedback (hover, entry, exit states)
- Cleaner animation orchestration using reusable GSAP logic

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- GSAP
- GSAP ScrollTrigger
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS / Utility-based styling

## Why This Project

The goal wasn’t just cloning visuals.

This project was built to:
- Understand how animation-heavy sites are structured
- Learn how professional studios orchestrate motion at scale
- Push React beyond static UI into **experience-driven design**
- Demonstrate frontend depth in interviews and portfolio reviews

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
